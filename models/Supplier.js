// Order's (Stage 5): totalAmount - amountPaid = balanceDue, i.e. what we
// still owe *them* rather than what a customer owes *us*.
//
// creditApplied (Stage 21 credit fix) — how much of the supplier's
// running creditBalance (see supplierSchema below) was used to offset
// *this* purchase's totalAmount before amountPaid/balanceDue were
// computed. Recorded per-purchase purely for audit/transparency (so a
// purchase history row can show "was partly covered by existing
// credit" rather than that credit silently vanishing into the balance
// math) — it's a snapshot, never re-read or re-applied after the fact.
//
// creditGenerated — the flip side: how much of amountPaid on *this*
// purchase went toward *new* credit rather than the purchase itself,
// because either the total was already fully covered by creditApplied
// above, or amountPaid simply exceeded what was left owed after that.
// Without this recorded separately, a row showing e.g. totalAmount=200,
// amountPaid=250, creditApplied=200 reads as contradictory — it looks
// like $450 of value went toward a $200 purchase. Recording the $250
// as creditGenerated makes clear all of it became new credit (since the
// $200 total was already paid for by existing credit, none of this
// purchase's own cash was needed), not that anything was double-counted.
